The goal here is to make a text based game, but we're going to use Interactive Fiction as our base. First, we want to navigate rooms like normal, but we want the description to stay on the page. Let's start be creating locations, the ability to move between them, and descriptions for each room which will stay on the page.

Just realized we need to think through how direction works. First, I really want this game to work with controller. IF games use a cardinal direciton system. It's very tempting to steal this, but I liked the idea of having more flexibility in my system. For example, what if we wanted to parallel hallways leading north from a room? Basically two NORTH exits? In this was a keyboard IF game we could just demand a specific prompt from the player. But if this needs to work with controller then we can't type specific text. Maybe we just add sub-connections on the same cardinal direction, and we ask the player which one they meant if there's more than one?

Maybe it's better to not overthink this. Let's hard to commit to the 4 cardinal directions and the intercardinal directions, as well as up and down. It's simple. The 8 cardinal directions already work on any directional input device, and I'm sure we can figure something out for up and down. So doing this, we need to specify the type of direction for any given connection in a location.

This is a smart idea because it will standardize movement throughout the world. And gives us a way to start planning how to implement controls for both controller and keyboard/mouse.

Let's steal the compass idea from that other game. With that, it was very easy to determine where we could go from any location. We should also steal the map. That was extremely useful, and helped make the world feel more real. There may not be enough space on screen for regular text and the map. We'll have to reflect on how we want this implemented.

Did some more thinking about actions. If we want this to be playable with a controller it needs to be easy to select between a variety of abilities and targets for those abilities. Like a modern 3D adventure game, I'm thinking we can streamline this by only having 4-5 actions, kinda like buttons on a controller. They'll probably be:

examine
talk
attack
interact

Maybe some others depending on game mechanics we can think of. Also, I think the types of targets could be simplified. Basically just:

NPCs
enemies
objects
exits

I was thinking the top half of the screen could be devoted to just the room description. Then the bottom have could be divided in columns each containing a list of those targets I mentioned above. A hotkey/button could be assigns to each column, and using a direction input chooses from those targets. After selecting a target, a popup menu of possible actions could appear. I suppose if we did it that way, we could have any number of actions for a given target.

Exits could be a separate pop-up menu instead of its own column. Perhaps we always show the compass, and descriptions of the exits. But when you hit a button, a travel hotkey of some kind, the compass becomes highlighted and now you can choose a direction on the compass to travel.

I suppose we could also implement mouse support so mouse users can just click on these things.

In traditional IF games you can just type what you want to do, and I think the parsers are smart enough to figure out the target and action in one swoop. And in those games I suppose the commands can be more complex than a simple "target" -> "action". So for this game I guess the challenge is how to make it intiutive to interact with targets in the description.

Will the game be too easy if all interactable game objects are just listed for the player undert "target" columns? Maybe, but I don't think I can know for sure until I try.

Also just realized we could easily put a description for each item in unused screen space when we highlight it. Or maybe we want examining an object to be a deliberate action? Something to explore.

Also making a note that, although I've already stated I want this to be playable with controller, I'd also like it to be playable on arcade stick. Partly because I think that'd be cool, but also it forces us to keep the control scheme so simple that it could work with any modern controller. It could maybe even work on a retro-gaming emulation device which usually only has a d-pad and 4 face buttons.

After doing some more reflecting, I think it's too hard to make up a plan for all of this in my head. Let's try adding some basic items to the rooms that we can examine. We'll play around with the controls for moving between rooms as well. I think if we can get moving between rooms and examining items to feel natural, then we're on the right path.

Actually, no, we have to think through how we want interacting with travel options and objects to work. Right now I just have it rigged to read arrow key inputs and change room on space press. But we're going to use those same arrow keys for selecting objects. Ah, perhaps we'll start with using our hotkey idea from earlier, where you choose a travel or targets menu first. I'm torn on how we should layout the travel options. I really like the idea of maintaining the compass layout but I can tell I'm unsure how that will work with selecting the options. So maybe we'll just use a list layout for now.

Maybe if instead of using a hotkey system, we simply list "travel" as option in addition to the targets in the room? Actually, we could have both. Let's try just listing travel as an option. Also let's just call it "move" from here on.

Just looked back over notes. I forgot we decided to list "move" as an option by default just like other items in the room. Or I should say "targets" in the room. Things that can be interacted with. I think I only said this because I'm not 100% sure what I want yet. And just making it a regular option gives us a way to keep moving forward to code. On reflection I don't think this will work well because movement is something separate from interacting with targets. It's kind of its own game mechanic.

Let's start thinking of the game in terms of different menus. And right now I can think of 2. There's the regular targets menu, when you can choose targets within a location like objects, characters, or enemies. And we'll have the movement menu where you can choose directions to move within a location. We could assign hotkeys/buttons that bring up these different menus. Also for the movement menu, I think we should layout the options like a compass, we'll put some sort of null option for directions that can't be selected. This gives us an elegant way to select everything, including up/down.

Let's try adding that menu first.

It occured to me I've lost site of the mini-map. I think we need to keep that otherwise it's too easy to lose track of where you are physically in the story. But for now, let's have the move menu in the bottom left where we used to have the compass. It basically is the compass, just a slightly different thing. So it will always be visible, you just can't interact with it until you select that menu with the hotkey.

I've got a movement menu now. I decided to only make it visible when in move mode. I'm not convinced I like the layout yet but we'll go with it for now. Next we should add targets within the room that can be examined.

I've decided I'd like to list targets, and then list options for targets after they've been selected. This is instead of doing something where you choose the action you want to perform first, then the target. Are we sacrificing gameplay creativity here? For example what if we wanted the player to try and "talk" to an inanimate object? I suppose we are, but ultimately any decision we make probably has a tradeoff. In this case I think selecting target then action is more intuitive and is worth it. 

I've been very focused on a game that will work with controllers. But perhaps in the future we can make a text game that relies on keyboard excusively. This would open up all kinds of control and creativity options. Or maybe we'll change our minds about how this game works partway through. It shouldn't be too hard a change since this whole system will rely on action -> target interactions.

Anyway, let's try adding items to the rooms which can be selected from the targets menu. We'll consider this to be "examining" the item. When this happens we'll display the examination description of the item. The user will have to press "back" to get back to the targets menu. I think we'll also display action options for the target here as well, but I'm not sure what those are yet, so we'll stick to just displaying the examination description.

We should probably change the name of "target" to "interactable" or something similar. Target isn't quite the right name.

Got a simple system going. But it's clear we'll need to think through targets more completely before going too far. These are how we'll interact with the entire game world. We haven't even thought about inventory yet. How does something like picking up a key and using it to unlock a chest in another room work? Should targets being something that can exist in a location as well as the player inventory? Do we have a traditional inventory?

Like so many things, let's just assume we have a traditional game inventory so we can keep moving forward. And we'll assume it's magical in the sense that it's not an explicit backpack or pouch on the player character. It just magically exists like in most games.

Actually, I think we can simple create the location "inventory" and leave it at that. We don't have to create this location in the game world. Targets already have the ability to reference it, and we can draw targets in the "inventory" location when displaying player inventory just like when viewing a location. As for keeping tack of what can/can't be in the inventory, I'm sure we can ignore that for now.

Or maybe we shouldn't. Perhaps now it's time to figure out talking to characters and picking up items. Those are key game concepts we'll use. Perhaps a target/interactable has the ability to enter the inventory simply based on whether or not it has the "take" action. We'll also have to think through actions for interactables.

I'm also still on the fence about what to call targets. It feels wrong but I also don't like "interactable". It's too long.

I'm tempted to steal the conversation format that Morrowind used. We just display whatever the character just said, and list conversation topics that can be selected. Actually, this is exactly how displaying location descriptions and targets works atm.

We may not want to hardcode every single "mode" the game can be in. I think I don't want to display the location description while having a conversation. We could probably just use the same updateable system we've used in other games here. Honestly we need to implement a system like that just so we have flexibility later on. Like if we want a section that simply narrates a bunch of text.

Perhaps we should start by reworking our current logic to use updateable nodes. Then we can write a conversation node.

Tried reflecting more on the interface. I want the information the player interacts with the most to be center screen. So I'm considering placing descriptions for targets within a location in center/top of the screen, move the location description to left side, and then list the actual interaction options menu below. Since targets could vary for the same location depending on game state, this gives us a way to vary the descriptions displayed front and center. And I think it feels clearer to the player what's happening in the underlying game mechanics without breaking immersion (hopefully). Additionally I bet we could list movement options along with 
targets, which I'm hoping will feel a little more organic. I mean, in a regular 3D action game, when you enter a room, you look around and decide what you want to do. It could be push a button, or read a piece of paper on a desk, talk to an NPC, or leave through a door you see. All these things are in the same sort of option space mentally, so I think it makes sense to list them in the same ui place.

All of this has to be tested though.

I'm a little worried about maintaining the compass layout we have right now. I do think keeping movement direction options consistent is important for good gameplay feel. So while most interactable options in a location could be listed in a regular list, I'm not sure how to incorporate movement options. We shouldn't remove the idea of just listing them in a regular list though. It's very possible that it'll feel totally natural, especially if we kept the same order all the time (North first, then West, East, and so on).

Actually I've sort of convinced myself, let's try listing movement options in a regular list next.

But there's something about target options that's bothering me. At the moment I'm considering displaying a description of everything, then listing the options. Here's an example:

---------------------------------
A small wooden table sits in the corner. And on top of it rests a single candle in a brass holder. Its flame is gentle. The glint of a key can be seen next to the candle. To the North you see a door. And to the West the wooden planks have fallen away revealing a stone wall with a hole small enough to crawl through.

- table
- candle
- key
- door (North)
- hole (West)
---------------------------------

What I don't like about this, is we've sort of listed everything twice. For example if the player wanted to interact with the key they have to read the sentence describing the key first, then select the option at the bottom of the screen. I almost feel like they should interact with that sentence itself. If we were comitted to mouse controls we could have the player click on the word itself (not a bad idea actually, keep that in mind for the future). Maybe it makes more sense to insist on each interactable being a separate sentence? Something like this:

---------------------------------
- A small wooden table sits in the corner.
- And on top of it rests a single candle in a brass holder. Its flame is gentle.
- The glint of a key can be seen next to the candle.
- To the North you see a door.
- To the West the wooden planks have fallen away revealing a stone wall with a hole small enough to crawl through.
---------------------------------

Actually I hate that. I want to keep blocks of descriptive text. I think it keeps you in the story better, instead of looking like obvious game options. Let's go with the first option. Looking over that I wonder if we actually need the location description on the side. I bet we could just put it right there with the descriptions of targets. Maybe all we need to separate the description of the room and the targets is a new line? Should movement options be listed before or after targets? Does it matter?
